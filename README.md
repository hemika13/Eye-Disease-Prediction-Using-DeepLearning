 - Project Demo Video Drive Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o93YlGAEN2wwNMTr4zxZ5qUWjRfe84u8/view?usp=sharing
## Overview
This project aims to classify various types of eye diseases based on images. These diseases are categorized into four main groups: Normal, Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, and Glaucoma. We employ deep learning techniques, including transfer learning, to build high-performance classifiers for disease detection using image data.

## Goals
Our primary goal is to develop a robust and accurate system for classifying eye diseases based on image data. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

- Create a deep learning model that can accurately classify eye images into four categories: Normal, Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, and Glaucoma.
- Leverage transfer learning to take advantage of pre-trained models for improved classification performance.
