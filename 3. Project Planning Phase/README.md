# [Project Planning Phase](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600240-1697595942/tree/main/3.%20Project%20Planning%20Phase)

In the Project Planning Phase, we lay the foundation for a successful execution of our deep learning model for the Eye disease prediction project. This phase involves the detailed planning and organization of the project.

## Project Planning Phase Objectives
1. Define and document the project's technology stack and requirements.
2. Create a structured plan for the project, focusing on sprint planning, user stories, and story points.
3. Allocate resources, assess risks, and set a clear project timeline.

## Key Activities

### 1. [Technology Stack](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600240-1697595942/blob/main/3.%20Project%20Planning%20Phase/Technology%20Stack.pdf)

- Here we define the project's technology stack, encompassing technical architecture, programming languages, and cloud deployment. This phase is crucial for selecting deep learning frameworks, libraries, and third-party APIs to ensure a robust foundation for the project's technical aspects.

- In this phase involves meticulous sprint planning, resource allocation, and risk assessment. User stories are crafted to outline system functionalities and story points are assigned to gauge task complexity. A well-defined project timeline, documentation requirements, and budget estimates are crucial components, alongside addressing security and compliance measures. This detailed planning paves the way for an organized and successful project execution.
