# [Ideation Phase](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600240-1697595942/tree/main/1)%20Ideation%20Phase)

Welcome to the Ideation Phase of our "Eye Disease Prediction using Deep Learning" project. In this phase, we have focused on gaining insights into our project's goals, understanding our target audience, and generating creative ideas. Here, we'll provide information about the key activities and materials used during this phase.

## Ideation Phase Objectives
- Understand the problem domain and context of the project.
- Define the scope and goals of the project.
- Identify potential users and stakeholders.
- Generate creative ideas for the project.

## Key Activities

## 1. [Empathy Map](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600240-1697595942/blob/main/Ideation%20Phase/Empathy%20Map%20Canvas.pdf) 
It is a valuable tool for understanding our users. It helped us gain insights into their thoughts, feelings, and needs.
We used a mural template for creating the Empathy Map. You can access the Map using the following link: [Empathy Map Mural Link](https://app.mural.co/t/empathymapforeyediseasepredi0797/m/empathymapforeyediseasepredi0797/1697527016984/da2a1a7da096b728794f4f015dc3ff3619936af1?sender=ube2471ea0bc3c5e994d27926).

## 2. [Brainstorming Map](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600240-1697595942/blob/main/Ideation%20Phase/Brainstorming%20Map.pdf)
Brainstorming is a collaborative creative process to generate ideas.
We used a mural template to capture our brainstorming session's outcomes. You can access the template by following this link: [Brainstorming Map Mural Link](https://app.mural.co/t/vit8192/m/vit8192/1697613854839/ba5b9c0fd54ee3baec6747978c849528e99ea03e?sender=ube2471ea0bc3c5e994d27926).

The Brainstorming Map template served as a visual representation of the ideas and suggestions generated during our brainstorming session. It captures various concepts, features, and potential solutions for our project.


## Next Steps
- Based on the insights gained from the Empathy Map and the ideas generated in the Brainstorming Map, we will proceed to the [Project Design Phase](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600240-1697595942/tree/main/Project%20Design%20Phase). This will involve defining the project's architecture and feature set.
