# [Project Design Phase](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600240-1697595942/tree/main/Project%20Design%20Phase)

In this phase, we focus on planning and designing the project. This README will provide an overview of the key activities and materials used during this phase.

## Project Design Phase Objectives
- Define and document the project's design and requirements.
- Establish a clear vision of the proposed solution and its feasibility.
- Develop the architectural framework for the project.
- Illustrates the systematic data flow within the system.

## Key Activities

### 1. [Proposed Solution](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600240-1697595942/blob/main/Project%20Design%20Phase/Proposed%20Solution.pdf)
- This  outlines the proposed solution for our project. It includes details on the uniqueness of the solution, novelty, social or business impact, and the feasibility of the concept.

### 2. [Solution Architecture](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600240-1697595942/blob/main/Project%20Design%20Phase/Solution%20Architecture.pdf)
- The Solution Architecture  guides you through how the project is planned and built, from the start to the deployment phase. It explains the structure and practical aspects of the project in a straightforward manner.

### 3. [Data Flow Diagram](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600240-1697595942/blob/main/Project%20Design%20Phase/Data%20Flow%20Diagram.pdf)
- A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a conventional method for visually depicting how information moves within a system. This offers a transparent DFD, visually illustrating how data enters and exits the system, any transformations it undergoes, and where it's stored. This visual representation helps to understand how data circulates and is processed within the system.

## Next Step
- Following the Project Design Phase, the project will transition to the [Project Planning Phase](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600240-1697595942/tree/main/Project%20Planning%20Phase). Here, the focus will be on determining the Technology Stack and elaborating the comprehensive project plan, ensuring a well-structured approach towards development and implementation.
